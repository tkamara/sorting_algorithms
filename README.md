# SORTING ALGORITHMS AND BIG O
### **BUBBLE SORT**

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);

You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

- in the best case

* in the average case

+ in the worst case

### **INSERTION SORT**

Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

Prototype: void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);

You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.

You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

- in the best case

* in the average case

+ in the worst case

### **SELECTION_SORT**

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

Prototype: void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size);

You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file 2-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

- in the best case

* in the average case

+ in the worst case

### **QUICK_SORT**

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm

Prototype: void quick_sort(int *array, size_t size);

You must implement the Lomuto partition scheme.

The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.

You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file 3-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

- in the best case

* in the average case

+ in the worst case
